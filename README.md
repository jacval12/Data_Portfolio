# 🚀 Data Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Portfolio**, showcasing projects across **SQL, Excel, Python, Power BI, and Machine Learning**.  
These projects cover a variety of data analytics topics, including **customer segmentation, churn analysis, sales strategy, data visualization**, and more.  

Each project demonstrates my ability to **analyze real-world data, extract actionable insights, and communicate findings effectively**, highlighting both **technical skills** (data cleaning, modeling, visualization) and **business-oriented thinking**.

## 📂 Project Organization

All projects are organized in the `Projects` folder. Each project is contained in its **own subfolder**, and the structure may vary depending on the project type and tools used.  

Typical subfolders for each project may include:

- **`data/`** : Datasets used in the project (Excel, CSV, etc.)  
- **`code/`** : Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, SQL queries, or other code files  
- **`dashboards/`** : Power BI dashboards (`.pbix`) or other interactive visualizations  
- **`README.md`** : Project-specific explanation, methodology, and results  

> **Note:** Not all projects will include every subfolder. For example:  
> - A Python project may have **`data/`** and **`code/`** but no **`dashboards/`**  
> - A Power BI project may have **`data/`** and **`dashboards/`** but no **`code/`**  
> - Some SQL projects may include only **`code/`** and **`data/`**  
>  
> Each project folder **always includes its own README**, explaining how to use the files, explore results, and understand the analysis.

## 🧭 How to Navigate

1. Open the `Projects` folder to view all projects.  
2. Enter a project subfolder to explore its **data, code, dashboards, and project-specific README**.  
3. Interactive dashboards or notebooks can be opened in their respective tools (**Power BI Desktop, Jupyter, SQL tools, etc.**) to reproduce or explore the results.
